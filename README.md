  Hi, I'm Matheus. I have about three years experience as a professional backend developer in the node.js ecosystem[^1]. Currently, there's not much to see around here, since almost all code I've written with professional standards is commited to private repositories[^2]. My LinkedIn profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-deister/) if you would like to know more about my work experience, skills and tools :).
    
  [^1]: More specifically, I'm currently writing microservices for a  high throughput distributed messaging platform responsible for processing automated customer-brand interaction. I use Node.js along MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Kafka and Redis (and also many 3rd party APIs) to make this happen.
  [^2]: Policy subject to change without further notice. Some projects may be publicized to show interest in a different stack, or because they may contain code that is useful to someone else.
